   <h1> Rebienald Khei Carpio </h1>
<p>      I have been passionate about coding since 2022, starting in 8th grade. Although I currently do not  </br>  have formal work experience, I have dedicated myself to developing my skills in web development </br> and programming. </p>
<p>I graduated with honors from Binakayan National High School, achieving academic distinction in </br> Grade 8, Grade 9, and Grade 10. I am currently pursuing further studies at STI (Systems Technology </br> Institute), where I am focused on advancing my knowledge in Information and Communication  </br> Technology (ICT).</p>
